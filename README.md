## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was made to visualize sensor timeseries data from a cultivation tank in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production. When a cell cultivation starts, it is given a unique BatchID.
The data consists of timeseries data for multiple batches. Each batch contains data from 4
sensors.

The navigation bar at the top can bring to two different views
1 st view visualizes the batch data for different sensors in the form of graphs. The user should be able to filter between batches and sensors to compare data.
2 nd view shows aggregated information about all the batches in the form of table, where user can see valuable information about process in batches (e.g., minimum, maximum, average, initial, last values of sensors for each batch).
